# Hydrogen.Maths

Hydrogen.Maths is a math utility library intended to add functions on top of Unity.Mathematics, in addition to our own custom math functions. This is primarily targeted towards runtime Game and App development at Periodyc, with performance in mind.

New functions will be periodically added as the need arises, although contributions are welcome.

Currently includes utility functions for packing bits.

See the Documentation for more details.
